**FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS**:

2) Form a list of KPIs for further work and tracking by the customer together with marketers.

**RESULT**

*Data overview summary*

Posts that are unique content of the Kinopoisk Telegram channel, as well as posts that are aimed at interacting with subscribers, short news and announcements of new films receive more reactions. This indicator (number of reactions) is informative and can be used as a metric for the effectiveness of a post.

Subscribers most often share posts about films, TV series (recommendations to friends), as well as short text posts that can be quickly viewed and forwarded - news, premieres and new releases.

Posts with the topic "friend" are viewed the most (the overwhelming majority are appeals and questions to readers, interactions with them, slightly less often news about partner projects).
Reviews, ratings and movie reviews also have high numbers of views.

*Metrics summary*

Views and their relationship with changes in the number of subscribers, the number of new subscribers, as well as the level of audience growth and daily churn:
All of these metrics have a logical connection with the view metrics. A large number of views can be associated with audience growth, new subscribers, and the total number of subscribers.

Reposts and their relationship with the number of reactions:
A positive correlation between the number of reposts and reactions is quite logical, since interesting content that elicits reactions is likely to be reposted more often.

Text length and its relationship with the number of punctuation marks - there is also a positive correlation.

Number of subscribers and its relationship with the number of emoji in the text:
Perhaps the use of emoji makes the content more attractive and interesting to the audience, which can lead to an increase in the number of subscribers (since there is a weak positive relationship with new subscribers and a weak negative relationship with unsubscribes). Perhaps the content of the post has an effect.

ER, as well as daily engagement of subscribers, are primarily related to the frequency of publications - the more publications, the higher the indicators.

The number of reactions and ERR - a strong positive relationship, which is logical, since err was calculated based on reactions, among other things

New subscribers: Positive correlation with the total number of views, weak positive correlation with the number of emojis and the length of the text. This may indicate that content that attracts a large number of new subscribers is likely to also have a large number of views.
